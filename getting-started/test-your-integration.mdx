Before you start accepting payments, test your Rocka integration to make sure everything's working as intended.

## Testing your integration

### Step 1. Get your test API key

1. Go to your [Rocka Hub](https://hub.rocka.live/integration) > **Integration**. You'll find your test API key under **Test credentials**.

2. To verify your site is connected to Rocka, make a test API call with your sandbox key. For example, you can try the [Get the list of top banks](https://docs.noda.live/reference/get-the-list-of-top-banks) endpoint. Make sure you select **Sandbox** in the server list.

### Step 2. Create your first payment

Try creating your first payment with your test API key. For more details, see [Create a payment](https://docs.noda.live/reference/create-a-payment). Once your test payments go through, you'll see them in the **Transactions** section in your Rocka Hub.

After you complete your onboarding in Rocka Hub, your live keys will become active.
