Before you start accepting payments, test your Rocka integration to make sure everything's working as intended.

## Test your integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make a test API call">
    1. Go to your [Rocka Hub](https://hub.rocka.live/integration) \> **Integration**. You'll find your test API key under **Test credentials**.
    2. To verify your site is connected to Rocka, make a test API call with your sandbox key. For example, you can try the Get the list of top banks endpoint. Make sure you select **Sandbox** in the server list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your first payment in sandbox mode">
    Try creating your first payment with your test API key. For more details, see Create a payment. Once your test payments go through, you'll see them in the **Transactions** section in your Rocka Hub.

    After you complete your onboarding in Rocka Hub, your live keys will become active.
