## Create your account

To set up your integration and start accepting payments, complete your onboarding in [Rocka Hub](https://hub.rocka.live). If you have any questions, please reach out to your personal manager.

You can start working on your integration while we're reviewing the documents.

## Start accepting payments

To start accepting payments, get your personal API keys. You can find them in the **Integration** tab on the left-hand sidebar in your [Rocka Hub](https://hub.rocka.live/). You'll need your keys to make every call to the API.

To learn more about the Rocka API, see our API reference. It'll guide you through the most basic use cases, including generating customised payment buttons and creating payments.

<Tip>
  Before you go live, make sure your integration works as expected. For more details, see Test your integration.
