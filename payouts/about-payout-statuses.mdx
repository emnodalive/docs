title: "About payout statuses"
---

Every payout goes through two temporary statuses (`Processing` and `Executing`) before arriving at a final status, which can be either of `Done`, `Failed` or `Rejected`.

To check the status of a payout, you can:

1. Look up the payout in your [Rocka Hub](https://hub.rocka.live/)
2. Use the [Check payout status](https://docs.noda.live/reference/check-payout-status#/) API endpoint
3. Retrieve it with a webhook.

## Payment statuses
