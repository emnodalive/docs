title: 'About payment statuses'
---

Every payment goes through three temporary statuses (`New`, `Processing` and `Awaiting Confirmation`) before arriving at a final status, either `Done` or `Failed`.

To check the status of a payment, you can:

1. Look the payment up in your [Rocka Hub](https://hub.rocka.live/)
2. Use the [Check payment status](https://docs.rocka.live/reference/check-payment-status#/) API endpoint
3. Retrieve it through a webhook.
