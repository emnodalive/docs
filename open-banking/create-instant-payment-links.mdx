**Rocka Instant Payment Links** are one-time payment links you can share with your customers. You can create payment links in your Rocka Hub or using our API endpoint.

### What to expect

* You can present payment links as either plain text links or QR codes.
* By default, payment links expire in 30 days. You can set a custom expiration date if you are using the API to create the payment link.

## Create a payment link using the API

### Step 1. Generate a link

To create a payment link, use the `POST /payments/short-links` endpoint ([Create payment links](https://docs.rocka.live/reference/create-payment-links#/)).

You request needs to include the `name`, `paymentDescription`, `amount` and `currency` parameters. The payment link name is only visible to you, but your customer will see the description on the payment form.

In the response, you will receive the payment short link and the link to the QR code.

  ```curl
    		curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.rocka.live/api/payments/short-links \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-api-key: your-key-goes-here' \
     --data '{
  "name": "Payment link",
  "paymentDescription": "You can complete your order here.",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "amount": 87
    	}'
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sample response" icon="fa-code">
  ```json
  {
  "id": "JnoSTolSKN",
  "name": "Payment link",
  "paymentDescription": "You can complete your order here.",
  "amount": 87,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdDate": "2025-09-18T16:21:31.4234278Z",
  "shortLinkUrls": {
    "shortLink": "https://nd.link/JnoSTolSKN",
    "qrCodeLink": "https://nd.link/JnoSTolSKN?qr"
  },
  "expiryDate": "2025-10-18T16:21:32.7225761Z"
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

### Step 2. Process the payment

When you are creating the payment link, you can specify the `returnUrl` the customer will be redirected to once the payment is completed or the `webhookUrl` for payment status updates:

```curl
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://myshop.com/hookurl",
  "returnUrl": "https://myshop.com/returnurl"
}
```
